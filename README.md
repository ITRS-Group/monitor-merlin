The Merlin project, or Module for Effortless Redundancy and Loadbalancing In
[Naemon](https://naemon.org), is a Naemon module built to create an easy way to
set up distributed Naemon installations, allowing Naemon processes to exchange
information. This allows Naemon to scale past a single installation to handle
a bigger monitoring workload.

Merlin can also save state changes to a database, which can be
used for reporting purposes.
