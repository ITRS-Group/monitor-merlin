# This script might be called from a Naemon worker process.
# As a result, if we do a stop and start of naemon seperatly, it might happen 
# that this script is killed before we issue the start command. Hence monitor
# ends up in a stopped state. Calling restart fixes this issue.
# However for some reason the service restart command does not exists until
# we have called service stop of either merlin or naemon. Therefore we first
# restart merlin with seperate commands, and thereafter restart naemon.
/sbin/service merlind stop && /sbin/service merlind start
